# parka_or_bikini  
A travel planning tool to help with understanding weather conditions along the road.  

## problem:  
A long drive from point A to point B may cross many different weather conditions.  In my case, the trips can be over 1000km a 'hop' and the weather can change a lot.  It would be nice to have an understanding of what weather that I could expect along the way.  Should I wear a parka or a bikini?

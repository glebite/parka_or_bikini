# parka_or_bikini  
A travel planning tool to help with understanding weather conditions along the road.  

## problem:  
A long drive from point A to point B may cross many different weather conditions.  In my case, the trips can be over 1000km a 'hop' and the weather can change a lot.  It would be nice to have an understanding of what weather that I could expect along the way.  Should I wear a parka or a bikini?  

## two paths:  
  
### python:  
Goal is to use QPython 3L for my Android device but this should run for everything in theory...  
It is only 3.6.6 but should be sufficient for running the minimal application.

### react native:  
I think this could be a good application for using react native.  

## requirements:  

### both paths:  
* openweather api application key  [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/)  

### python:  
* requests module  
* possibly curses  

### react native:  
* learn how to code in it  ;)
